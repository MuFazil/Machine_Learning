    "Least Angle Regression (LARS) is a regression algorithm designed to handle datasets with a large number of features (attributes) relative to the number of samples. It works similarly to forward stepwise regression, but with some key improvements, especially in terms of speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "1. Start at Zero: LARS starts with a model that predicts the target as the mean (or zero if normalized). In this state, none of the features are used yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the Most Correlated Feature: At each step, LARS identifies the feature (or attribute) that is most correlated with the target value (i.e., the one that can best explain the difference between the modelâ€™s current predictions and the actual target values).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Move Along That Feature: Instead of adding this feature entirely (like stepwise regression), LARS moves in the direction of this feature, gradually increasing its coefficient. The model keeps moving in this direction until another feature becomes equally correlated with the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Move in the Optimal Direction: If more than one feature is equally correlated with the target at some point, LARS moves in a direction that splits the difference. This means that it moves along a direction that is equally angled between the most correlated features (hence the name \"Least Angle\"). This helps the algorithm avoid focusing too much on any one feature, which reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat: The process repeats, progressively adding more features and adjusting their coefficients as needed, until the model becomes a good fit for the data."
