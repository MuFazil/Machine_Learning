    "### 1. Linear vs Non-linear Relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, the relationship between predictors (X) and the response (Y) is assumed to be a straight line:\n",
    "𝑌=𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑋 + 𝜖  \n",
    "In polynomial regression, a higher degree (e.g.,  𝑋2, 𝑋3) is used to model more complex curves: \n",
    "\n",
    "𝑌=𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑋 + 𝛽2𝑋^2 + ⋯ + 𝛽ℎ𝑋^ℎ + 𝜖\n",
    "While this allows for more flexibility, polynomial regression can easily overfit the data or fail to generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MARS – Adapting to Non-linear Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "MARS overcomes some of the limitations of polynomial regression by splitting the data into k segments and fitting a regression model to each segment.\n",
    "These segments are formed based on knots (specific points in the data) where the relationship between X and Y changes. The goal is to minimize error by choosing the best split points (knots).\n",
    "After identifying these knots, MARS creates what’s called hinge functions to model each piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hinge Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hinge function is a piecewise linear function that allows MARS to model different relationships on either side of a knot. For instance:\n",
    "If a knot is placed at 4.3, the model fits one regression equation for values of X < 4.3 and another for values of X > 4.3.\n",
    "For more complex data, multiple knots can be used to divide the dataset into smaller segments.\n",
    "Choosing the Number of Knots (k):\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. k-fold cross-validation\n",
    " is used to evaluate different models with varying numbers of knots. The model that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on test data is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros:\n",
    " * Works well for regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "* Handles non-linear relationships efficiently.\n",
    "* It can be applied to large datasets and doesn’t require you to scale or standardize variables beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It may not perform as well as more advanced non-linear methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines.\n"
