    "Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) is an extension of Momentum Gradient Descent. It evaluates the gradient at a hypothetical position ahead of the current position based on the current momentum vector, instead of evaluating the gradient at the current position. This can result in faster convergence and better performance."
